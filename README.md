## Navigate to Your Rails Application Directory

Use the `cd` command to change into the directory where your Ruby on Rails application is located. For example:

```bash 
cd path/to/your/rails/app
```
## Install Dependencies

```
bundle install
```
## Start the Rails Server
Start the Rails server using the rails server or rails s command. 
This command starts the server on the default port 3000:

```
rails s
```
## Access Your Rails Application

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000. You should see your Ruby on Rails application running.

application up and running.
